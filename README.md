# styleshit

styleshit is a responsive web design previewer to aid you in your responsive
development (works with local and remote projects).

# Issues

- X-Frame-Options can forbid the rendering of contents
- On non-webkit browsers, the width of each emulated device might not correspond
  to the true width.
- Scroll bars are hidden, so you'll have to use your mouse scroll wheel.
